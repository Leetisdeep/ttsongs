### Using
Right now you can run server.py so you can see web on your own(running as local)
"http://127.0.0.1:5000/today"

### Info
So this is an app(web) which just parse songs and displays list of those songs
It uses https://www.tokhits.com/songs/trending to parse songs (thanks to the owner of the web too)
but code could get adepted to any other website too

### Extra info
In a better way you would need to store html and style as files , while i store them as strings on server.py
And overall there is many things which could get improved
