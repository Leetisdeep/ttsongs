### Using
Right now you can run server.py so you can see web on your own(running as local)

### Info
It uses https://www.tokhits.com/songs/trending to parse songs
but code could get adepted to any other website too

### Extra info
In a better way you would need to store html and style as files , while i am store them as strings on server.py
